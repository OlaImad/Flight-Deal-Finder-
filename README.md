# Flight-Deal-Finder-

Finds the best flight deals based on the user's preferred destinations and prices then sends SMS to the registered Mobile phone number.

The program will run daily in the cloud on predetermined time intervals and if a deal was found will send an SMS with info of the flight
and a link to reserve it. All based on the user's preferred destinations and prices.(You can enter as many destinations as you wish,
each with its related low price that you think it is a Greate Deal).

I have used OOP, APIs, Datetime, List and Dictionary Comprehensions. APIs used: Sheety API, Tequila Flight Search API, Twilio SMS API.
